# Speaker Diarization Configuration for Transcript Processing
#
# This configuration controls advanced speaker identification and labeling
# in transcription and subtitle generation. It provides fine-grained control
# over how different speakers are detected, labeled, and presented in the output.
#
# Key Features:
# - Dynamic speaker detection with confidence thresholds
# - Customizable speaker label formatting
# - Intelligent segment merging to improve readability
# - Maximum speaker limit to prevent overwhelming output
#
# Supported Use Cases:
# - Subtitle generation (SRT)
# - Markdown documentation
# - Speaker analysis reports
#
# Configuration Impact:
# Adjusting these settings can significantly improve the quality and
# readability of multi-speaker transcripts.

speaker_diarization:
  # Enable or Disable Speaker Processing
  # When enabled, attempts to identify and distinguish between different speakers
  # Recommended for multi-speaker recordings like interviews, meetings, podcasts
  enable: true
  
  # Speaker Confidence Threshold
  # Controls the strictness of speaker identification
  # * Range: 0.0 (lenient) to 1.0 (very strict)
  # * Higher values mean only highly confident speaker assignments are used
  # * 0.8 means speakers must be identified with 80%+ confidence
  # * Affects the number and reliability of speaker labels
  confidence_threshold: 0.5
  
  # Speaker Label Format
  # Defines how speakers are labeled in the output
  # * Must include a '%d' placeholder for the speaker number
  # * Supports flexible formatting for different presentation styles
  # Examples:
  #   "[Speaker %d]: "    → "[Speaker 1]: Hello"
  #   "S%d: "             → "S1: Hello"
  #   "Person %d speaks: " → "Person 1 speaks: Hello"
  label_format: "[Speaker %d]: "
  
  # Merge Consecutive Speaker Segments
  # Determines how short, consecutive speech segments are handled
  # * true: Combines multiple short segments from the same speaker
  # * false: Keeps each segment separate, even if from the same speaker
  # Helps create more coherent and readable transcripts/subtitles
  merge_consecutive_segments: true
  
  # Minimum Segment Duration
  # Filters out extremely brief speech segments
  # * Helps reduce noise and fragmentation in the output
  # * Segments shorter than this will be merged with adjacent segments
  # * Useful for handling brief pauses, interruptions, or background noise
  # * Recommended range: 0.5 to 2.0 seconds
  min_segment_duration: 1.0
  
  # Maximum Speakers to Process
  # Limits the number of unique speakers that will be individually labeled
  # * Prevents overwhelming output with too many speaker identifications
  # * Remaining speakers beyond this limit will be omitted or generically labeled
  # * Recommended range: 3 to 10 speakers
  max_speakers: 10

# Performance and Accuracy Notes:
# - Speaker diarization accuracy depends on recording quality
# - Background noise and overlapping speech can reduce performance
# - Always test and adjust settings for your specific use case
